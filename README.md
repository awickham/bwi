This repository contains code for parts of UT Austin's undergraduate BWI (building-wide intelligence) research. Our twitterbot code that allows the robots to tweet is in the twitterbot folder. There is a much more detailed readme file there that discusses that project at length, including an overview of how it works and how to use it. The text-generation folder contains code that will allow the robots to create their own texts to tweet or otherwise interact with people around the building.
