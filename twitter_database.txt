***BEGIN COMMENT***
This file contains the text that makes up the default twitter_database. This
includes things like emotions, parts of speech (like adjective or adverb), and
hashtags that the robots will use when generating tweets.

Here we map emotions (in the form of emoticons, such as a smiley face) to their
default ratios. This is how it works: add up all the ratios into a sum; then,
when a emotion must be chosen to use within a tweet, emotions with higher ratios
have a greater chance of being picked. For instance, if all the ratios are the
same (as in this default definition), all emotions have an equal chance of
being chosen. On the other hand, suppose :) has a ratio of 3 and :( has a ratio
of 1. In this case, the :) emotion will be chosen 3/4 of the time, while the :(
is only chosen 1/4 of the time. These ratios may be overwritten by particular
robots to give them more distinct personalities.

EMOTION RATIOS
:) = 1
:D = 1
:( = 1
:'( = 1
:/ = 1
-.- = 1
:s = 1
>:( = 1
<3 = 1
END EMOTION RATIOS

***BEGIN COMMENT***
Here we map emotions (in the form of emoticons, such as a smiley face) to
adjectives that someone with those emotions might use. These adjectives are NOT
describing the emotion itself. For instance, if the emotion is >:(, words like
"terrible" are better suited than words like "angry," even though "angry" seems
more align with the emoticon. This is because a tweet like "Today is a terrible
day! >:(" makes much more sense than "Today is an angry day! >:("

NOTE: These adjectives do not include participles (verbs acting as adjectives,
such as depressed [past participle] and depressing [present particple]). These
are addressed in later sections below this one.

Where there's a tweet, there's gotta be hashtags! Here are generic hashtags
that will work with pretty much any tweet. These will typically be entertaining.

This is where things get really interesting. We map various keys to reasonable
responses that will then be tweeted. However, you'll notice some strange syntax
that needs some explaining. Throughout the text, there are a number of "dynamic
tokens," which are enclosed in angular brackets (< and >) and will be replaced
by dynamic content at runtime.
