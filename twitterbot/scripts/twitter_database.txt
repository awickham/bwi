***BEGIN COMMENT***
This file contains the text that makes up the default twitter_database. This
includes things like emotions, parts of speech (like adjective or adverb), and
hashtags that the robots will use when generating tweets.
***END COMMENT***

***BEGIN COMMENT***
Here we map emotions (in the form of emoticons, such as a smiley face) to their
default ratios. This is how it works: add up all the ratios into a sum; then,
when a emotion must be chosen to use within a tweet, emotions with higher ratios
have a greater chance of being picked. For instance, if all the ratios are the
same (as in this default definition), all emotions have an equal chance of
being chosen. On the other hand, suppose :) has a ratio of 3 and :( has a ratio
of 1. In this case, the :) emotion will be chosen 3/4 of the time, while the :(
is only chosen 1/4 of the time. These ratios may be overwritten by particular
robots to give them more distinct personalities.

Here we map emotions (in the form of emoticons, such as a smiley face) to
adjectives that cause those emotions. As an example, we want adjectives that
will fit the first <adj> token in "The <adj> person/day made me <adj>."

To extend the previous section, we map emotions to adjectives that describe those
emotions (this is different from the previous section, where the adjectives
*caused* the emotions). As an example, we want adjectives that will fit the
second <adj> token in "The <adj> person/day made me <adj>."

Where there's a tweet, there's gotta be hashtags! Here are generic hashtags
that will work with pretty much any tweet. These will typically be entertaining.

This begins the weather portion of the database. There are three categories:
WEATHER POSITIVE and WEATHER NEGATIVE, and WEATHER NEUTRAL. Each category lists
tweets of the corresponding temperament that include parameters such as
<high-temp> or <precip-inches>; these will be filled in at runtime like any
other dynamic token. Additionally, tweets from this list will only be
considered if its parameters match the temperament they are under - for
instance, "Loving this <sky-description> sky!" under WEATHER POSITIVE will only
be tweeted if <sky-description> is a positive description such as "sunny"; that
way, it won't tweet something ridiculous like "Loving this overcast sky!". To
further prevent ridiculous posts, tweets with both positive and negative params
will be ignored. (Ex: "I can tell today is going to be a great day! Sunny skies,
a high of 75, and a ton of rain! :D" will NOT be tweeted because "a ton of" rain
is not positive.)

WEATHER POSITIVE
Loving this <sky-description> sky!
Ah, a high of <high-temp> and a low of <low-temp>! Not too hot and not too cold. <emoticon_:)_:D_<3|hashtag-emotion_:)_:D_<3>

<is-hot?> It may be warm out, but at least there is a <adj-cause_:)|text_"nice"> <wind-speed> MPH breeze. :)
<is-clear?> <text_"Wow!"_"Amazing!"_"Take a look outside!"> There's hardly a cloud in sight!
What a pretty view! The sky is <sky-description> with a high of <high-temp>. <hashtag-emotion_:)>

WEATHER NEGATIVE
Ugh, there's <precip-amount> rain! <precip-inches> inches expected today. <emoticon_:(_:'(_:/>
I can't see the sun. <emoticon_:(_:/> The clouds are covering <cloud-coverage-percent>% of the sky. <emoticon_:(_:/_:'(>
A high of <high-temp-cold> degrees and a low of <low-temp-cold>?! My motors are going to refuse to move! <emoticon_:(_:/_:'(|hashtag-emotion_:s_:(|>
I'm glad I don't sweat... today's high is <high-temp-hot> and there is <humidity-percent>% humidity. <emoticon_:(_:/|> <text_:)="Maybe that means more people will be inside to visit me! :)"_:(="What a <adj-cause_:(_:'(> day!">

WEATHER NEUTRAL
Today's weather: high of <high-temp> and low of <low-temp>. Plus <cloud-coverage-percent>% cloud coverage and <precip-inches> inches of precipitation. tl;dr: <weather-description>

This is where things get really interesting. We map various keys to reasonable
responses that will then be tweeted. However, you'll notice some strange syntax
that needs some explaining. Throughout the text, there are a number of "dynamic
tokens," which are enclosed in angular brackets (< and >) and will be replaced
by dynamic content at runtime.
