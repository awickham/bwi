***BEGIN COMMENT***
This file contains the text that makes up the default twitter_database. This
includes things like emotions, parts of speech (like adjective or adverb), and
hashtags that the robots will use when generating tweets.

***BEGIN COMMENT***
Here we map emotions (in the form of emoticons, such as a smiley face) to their
default ratios. This is how it works: add up all the ratios into a sum; then,
when a emotion must be chosen to use within a tweet, emotions with higher ratios
have a greater chance of being picked. For instance, if all the ratios are the
same (as in this default definition), all emotions have an equal chance of
being chosen. On the other hand, suppose :) has a ratio of 3 and :( has a ratio
of 1. In this case, the :) emotion will be chosen 3/4 of the time, while the :(
is only chosen 1/4 of the time. These ratios may be overwritten by particular
robots to give them more distinct personalities.

Here we map emotions (in the form of emoticons, such as a smiley face) to
adjectives that cause those emotions. As an example, we want adjectives that
will fit the first <adj> token in "The <adj> person/day made me <adj>."

To extend the previous section, we map emotions to adjectives that describe those
emotions (this is different from the previous section, where the adjectives
*caused* the emotions). As an example, we want adjectives that will fit the
second <adj> token in "The <adj> person/day made me <adj>."

Where there's a tweet, there's gotta be hashtags! Here are generic hashtags
that will work with pretty much any tweet. These will typically be entertaining.

This is where things get really interesting. We map various keys to reasonable
responses that will then be tweeted. However, you'll notice some strange syntax
that needs some explaining. Throughout the text, there are a number of "dynamic
tokens," which are enclosed in angular brackets (< and >) and will be replaced
by dynamic content at runtime.
